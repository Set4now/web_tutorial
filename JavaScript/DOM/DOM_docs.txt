===========DOM=========
Document Object Model
it's the DOM thats get created when html gets rendered.
DOM and html both are documents.
they are just diff representation.
evry tag has a corresponding object
javascript works on objects not on html tags directly because html is just a markup language

there are 12 types of nodes
1. element ( tags)
2. attribute ( id,class etc)
3. text (the text inside p)


javascript is a two steps process'
1. get the elements
2. style or work on the elements

getelementsbytagname
getelementsbyid
getelementbyclassName

Traversing the DOM
function changeText () {
 
var parent = document.getElementById('main');
var child = parent.firstElementChild;
var child = parent.lastElementChild;
child.style.color = "blue";
 
// var child = parent.childNodes[3]; // Note childnodes can contain any nodes including spaces as well
}

How to get and change the parent?
var child = document.getElementById('p1');
var parent = child.parentNode;
parent.style.color = "blue";

How to get siblings?
